				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, I wanted to create a scene that references some of my favorite recent video games: "Alan
					Wake 2" and "Metaphor: ReFantazio". I wanted to match the compositon of a scene in "Metaphor" and use lyrics from
					a song in "Alan Wake 2". So, I knew I wanted the scene to have moving waves and a lighthouse, but to be contained in the pupil 
					of an eye. I also wanted an interactive element where the lighthouse's light could progressively "die" with every user click.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I followed a lot of tutorials to familiarize myself with p5.js. I needed to learn how to rotate the canvas to 
					achieve the eye's angle, the order that shapes are drawn in, how to add the interactive element, and more. For the waves, I found
					an existing p5.js sketch from pippinbarr titled <a href ="https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/sketches/bgKTIXoir"> "Wave Motion"</a> which 
					I modified to fit within the pupil.

					As for the sketch itself, after setup(), a scale for the x and y is set up for resizing purposes, and then the canvas is rotated
					in order to draw the eye background and then the black background of the pupil. The canvas is rotated back to normal, and the
					lighthouse shapes and its light are drawn, and then the waves are drawn using pippinbarr's drawWaves() function. Afterward, the 
					canvas is rotated again to draw the ellipse that represents the iris of the eye over the lighthouse and waves. 

					For the mousePressed() function, the current light shape gets erased and then gets replaced with a shape that has a lower blue and green value
					until it becomes black. If the shape's blue value is already at 0, then the shape gets reset to its starting values. 
					</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a somewhat difficult experiment for me. I was glad to have been able to work on a piece that resonates with me because it 
					references some important/favorite games of mine, which kept me motivated to try and finish this. This also required me to get more familiar
					with p5.js, especially with how rotating shapes work, the draw order, interactivity, and how to scale sketches to match different canvas sizes. 
					I think the biggest difficulty came near the end when I had to make the sketch look good on this website where the canvas size can differ. I spent
					a long time tweaking values and changing the order of my code, etc. But I think it worked it out, which I can now consider a success. I think
					I was able to match the composition of the scene in "Metaphor" (which is another success), but the lighthouse looks really rudimentary since it is just made
					up of three shapes, so maybe I should have spent more time on that. It would have been really cool to make the waves interactive, like maybe the peak 
					of the waves would change depending on the mouse position, but I didn't have the time to research and implement that. The sketch could definitely
					be improved, but I think I learned a lot from the process, and we shall see how future experiments turn out.
