				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I worked with my classmate, Keven Paw. He recalled a segment from an educational show where two knights with a part of a word above
					their heads would collide to create the word. We thought it would be interesting to take that idea of bubbles with sounds colliding into each other and getting
					a text-to-speech library to read out the combination. 
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> After we settled on the idea, we looked to existing sketches and libraries as a starting point. We found a <a href=" https://editor.p5js.org/hao/sketches/8OhA3cn1J">p5.js sketch by hao</a> which uses text-to-speech
					that led us to learning about R. Luke DuBois' <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">p5.speech library</a>. We decided we needed a wordBubble class so that each bubble
					could have its own word, x and y position, a speed, and velocity. We also needed a colliding function within the class, which was done with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAfw-ko3kB8">this Coding Train video</a> and 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY-c2HO2liA&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=1&t=0s">this video</a>. There were also other functions to draw the bubbles and to move their x and y positions. The bubbles are created during setup() and 
					the speech library is also initialized. Some global variables that were used include an array that contains all the phonemes that a bubble could get, a max number of bubbles drawn at the beginning, and a 
					diameter for all the bubbles to have. In the draw function, the bubbles are moved and redrawn and their colliding function is called to see if they have hit another bubble. Once that happens,
					the draw loop is stopped so that the user can see a collision has happened and the sounds belonging to each collided bubble are passed to the speech library in an order that we settled on. The library reads this combined sound 
					and then the draw loop resumes until the next collision.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Originally, we weren’t too sure if this experiment was within the suggested constraints. It also does not venture too in-depth into the topics related; however, after reassurance from Sai, we pressed on. 
					The concept stems from old-school educational programs that teach kids to read, but with the weird inhuman text-to-speech interpreting the random words. One aspect that could have been improved is how often the program interprets words like: cnn or tcn. 
					It would usually just abbreviate them to: C.N.N. or T.C.N, which wasn’t what we were looking for, but it would require far more tweaking of the actual API. We would have also liked to have created a visual effect similar to <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/Ne8is2yx7">Wes's Meta Balls</a>, with its fluorescent lighting and ASCII text shape. 
					Overall, while the weekend was hectic, we were able to work together and find time to collaborate. For the most part, we were on a call and used liveshare via VS Code. For working on an experiment with a partner, things went pretty smoothly.
