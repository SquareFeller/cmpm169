				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I was inspired by the way Alexander Chen's <a href = "http://mta.me"> "mta.me"</a> had lines that when intersected would
					have a strum and I thought about a project where you could sturm lines by moving your mouse over it. And then I eventually decided to incorporate
					some voice pitch detection into it, so that some lines/notes would be played depending on what sound you made. The microphone is always on for this 
					one and it is incredibly sensitive.  
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>After being inspired by Chen's project, I spent time on openprocessing.org and found <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2306856"> "Little Guitar"</a> by 
					Syed Umer Ahmed / Karsten Schuhl. It was exactly what I had in mind, so I used Ahmed's work as well as the sound files included
					for the basis of this project. I removed the keyboard functionality from it and then added a reverb sound to each rectangle with help from the p5.js reference page. I made more minor visual
					changes like increasing the size of the particles and reducing the alpha value for each rectangle. The next step 
					was microphone integration and pitch detection. I found Jenny-yw's <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Jenny-yw/sketches/J1GteCrzt"> "pitch detection sketch"</a> which gave me a good 
					starter for just taking getting the pitch from the microphone and then I combined that code with ml5's <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/kpWGN573Ij"> "PitchDetection_Piano sketch"</a>
					because that one was focused on mapping the incoming pitch to a note on a piano's scale. With this two projects,
					I was able to adapt the starting project with microphone input and pitch detection by assigning each rectangle a note,
					and then checking to see if that note matched the current note. The microphone is still really sensitive, so the notes were being played rapidly and frequently. 
					To try to manage this, there is a maximum of 20 notes that can come from the microphone before the screen prompts you to strum a note.
					Once a note is strummed, the "singing" can resume. So both mouse and microphone functionality are included, which I find interesting.
					However, the microphone input still remains very sensitive, so that is something to keep in mind.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was much more rushed. I struggled to get started with this one and once I found Ahmed's project, I was not really sure where to take it. I can't quite call
					this my project because it still feels like Ahmed's to me. I thought the pitch detection was going to add some innovation to it, but it was not implemented as well as I would have liked.
					It also did not help that this week was a pretty important one for my 171 group and our project, so I was much more focused on that this week. I do like that I got to tinker
					more with p5.Sound and discover this new ml5 library. However, the audio and visuals aren't really married well in this project nor is the interactive component as 
					refined as I might have been able to make it. Still, with the help of Ahmed, Jenny-yw, and ml5, I was able to see the project that I had envisioned at the start of this 
					experiment.
