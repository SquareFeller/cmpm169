				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I wanted to do something with bubbles rising to the top of the screen. However, I did not want them to just
					suddenly appear on screen and then rise. So, I decided to have them spawn at the mouse's current position and then rise to the top.
					I think that helped to create an interactive element for the sketch. Beyond that, I wanted to experiment with audio input, so the user
					is also able to enable their computer microphone and if the volume passes a certain threshold, the bubbles rise to the top significantly
					faster. To enable your microphone, please hold down left shift.  
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I first began by using Andrew Aaron's <a href ="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/868184"> "Cute Bubbles"</a> as a starting point for creating the 
					bubbles. However, I knew I was going to have to change the x and y positions of the bubbles to spawn at the mouse's current position, so I then found
					a p5.js sketch by melodyloveless titled <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/melodyloveless/sketches/l5GR7rWbF"> "Simple Trailing Animation (push and shift) copy"</a> for help 
					making the mouse trail. The code creates a list to store the current x and y position of the mouse at each frame. The values are pushed to the list during 
					the draw() loop, and with the help of the p5.js sketch, I was able to create a trail of bubbles. The next step was to get each spawned bubble and send it up to
					the top, which was done by subtracting the y position of each bubble. I asked ChatGPT for some assistance with it by asking "can you make a p5js sketch that creates a mouse trail of ellipses, but then sends each ellipse to the top of the screen?"
					which also led me to change the original "Cute Bubbles"' code to just draw the bubbles within the draw() loop, instead of in the Bubbles class
					that was originally there. The final element was to get more interactive by messing with microphone input. I found a good starting point with
					amcc's p5.js sketch, <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/amcc/sketches/Jtg4GaAG0"> "microphone"</a>. I made some modifications so that
					holding down the left shift key starts the microphone and if the volume passes a certain threshold, the y position of the bubbles is decreased
					by a much greater value.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was at times a bit more smoother but also a bit more difficult than the first one. I did not have a clear starting vision like 
					I had for Experiment 2, so I had to spend more time thinking of an idea to pursue. However, once I decided on bubbles rising to the top, there 
					ended up being a lot of examples for things like the creation of the bubbles, the mouse trail, and the microphone input. I am not entirely sure how much
					of this experiment really fits the "generative" component because the size and shape of the bubbles are not very random nor are their spawn points. Although,
					I do quite like how it follows the mouse and how the microphone input can change how much the bubbles rise. it was a lot of fun to tinker with audio input and I 
					think I would like to continue to experiment with it for future assignments.
