				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> PLEASE CLICK ON CANVAS FOR AUDIO TO LOAD <br>
					For this assignment, I saw a project by Richard Bourne on OpenProcessing called <a href= "https://openprocessing.org/sketch/738171"> "3D Text" </a> and I liked the way the text got bigger as it got
					closer to the screen and smaller as it got further away. That idea reminded me of the (likely false) story surrounding one of the first films "The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station", which 
					is that the audience thought the train, as it got closer to the camera, was going to leave the screen and crash into them. Panic and chaos ensued, as per the story. So I wanted to take that 
					film and story and try to capture that in the piece, using a 3D train model that gets louder as it gets closer and an audience screaming once it gets as close as it can. The train is controlled by you 
					and the scroll of your mouse. <br><br>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I learned about orbitControl() from Bourne's project and decided it would be essential for my project. I combined orbitControl() with the mousePressed() function to keep track of when the 
					mouse is being scrolled up and when it is being scrolled down. The direction of the mouse scroll would determine whether to increase the volume of the train sound or decrease it. I then looked for a 3D train model 
					and found z-lengyel's model, which I reoriented in Blender. However, the camera is also adjusted during setup() so that it can frame the train in a way that somewhat matches the original film.
					The film grain effect also took some time to achieve, but I learned of the <a href= "https://github.com/meezwhite/p5.grain"> p5.grain library</a> which took care of most of the work for me. I found <a href = "https://github.com/meezwhite/p5.grain/blob/main/examples/texture-overlay-outside/style.css">example code</a> from 
					the Github, which I used in my sketch.js file and style.css file in order to overlay luis_molinero's image over the canvas and animate it.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was also rushed like experiment 4. I wasn't quite sure what to do for this one, but once my mind went to replicating "The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station", I felt much more motivated. I am not super pleased with the scale of the model because it doesn't quite convey a massive 
					train coming towards the screen, but this was likely the best I could do with the time I had. I also would have liked to have spent more time on the audio because the audience audio only plays once and I just have to hope that the user is able to hear it when it happens. I am afraid of this experiment being another intance of 
					not being quite enough because it ultimately really is just one object drawn that gets bigger and smaller depening on the scroll of the mouse. The film grain effect could have been improved because it can be a bit tough on the eyes. Still, though, I am glad that I came up with an idea for this one that was enough to get me motivated
					and while I definitely could have done more, I still like it.
