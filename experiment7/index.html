          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>For this assignment, I worked again with my classmate, Keven Paw. We spent some time thinking of what sort of data we could visualize. We decided on tracking our own data, in particular our mood over the course of a day at 30-minute intervals. 
            We wanted colors to represent the moods and the length of each bar to represent the intensity of that mood. We were inspired by the aurora borealis and its color palette. In an effort to make the data a tad more 
            interesting, we decided not to reveal what mood the colors correlate to as an opportunity for you, the viewer, to infer and wonder how we felt that day.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p> We started by reviewing "The Coding Train" videos for guidance on how to parse CSV files and using the <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js library</a>. From there, it became a matter of referencing the chart.js documentation
            frequently to create the floating bar chart and parse data from a CSV file we created that held the time, the intensity of our moods, and the colors of our moods.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            We had spent a lot of time trying to decide on how to innovate data visualization. It’s definitely a field that requires more thought and time to really branch off from what most people typically see. For us personally, it’s also easier in other mediums than just coding to make something truly unique.
            we wanted to further improve the chart by adding animations or a shader that could make it look more aurora-like. In the end, we decided to call it as our time would allow.
